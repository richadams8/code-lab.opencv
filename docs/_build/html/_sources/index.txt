   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

CV2 Python Documentation
===========================================

OpenCV uses :class:`numpy.ndarray<numpy:numpy.ndarray>` to store images, which
means it plays very nicely with the scipy stack.

Contents:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    sections/cv2_io
    sections/cv2_display
    sections/cv2

Examples
------------------

I also recommend looking at `these tutorials <http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
